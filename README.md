# Project TODO List

- **In Progress**: What needs to be done now is figure out how the rule management and in particular selection needs to happen.
  Should an isApplied flag be added to each rule (and the interface)?
  How should the rule selection UI process be handled and how should they be added and managed for application?

- **Implement Listeners Throughout**

- **Add Tests**

- **Possibly Format like Chess Project**

- **Clean-up/Finish Project**
