Given the nature of the game and the code provided, here are some design patterns that could be beneficial:

1. **Factory Pattern**: You already have a `RuleFactory` in your code. You can extend this pattern to other parts of your code where you're
   creating objects based on conditions. This can help to encapsulate object creation logic and make the code more maintainable.

2. **Observer Pattern**: This pattern is useful when you have objects that need to stay in sync with each other. It seems like you have some
   event-driven functionality in your code. The observer pattern could be used to notify other parts of your system when events occur.

3. **Strategy Pattern**: This pattern could be useful in your `RuleManager` class. Instead of having a large `switch` statement to determine
   which rule to apply, you could encapsulate each rule into its own strategy class. This would make adding new rules easier and make your
   code more maintainable.

4. **Singleton Pattern**: If you have classes that only need to have a single instance throughout the application, you can use the Singleton
   pattern. This ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

5. **State Pattern**: This pattern could be useful for managing the state of the game. Instead of using a series of `if` or `switch`
   statements to determine what happens based on the state of the game, you could encapsulate the state-related behavior into separate
   classes.

6. **Command Pattern**: This pattern could be useful for handling user actions. Each action the user can take could be encapsulated in a
   command object. This would make it easier to add new actions and would decouple the code that invokes the action from the code that
   performs it.

Remember, design patterns are tools to solve common problems, but they are not a silver bullet. They should be used when they help to make
the code more understandable, maintainable, and flexible.
